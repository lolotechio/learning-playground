# Data Structures & Algorithms Exercises

This repository contains exercises and solutions inspired by the Udemy course **[Master the Coding Interview: Data Structures + Algorithms](https://www.udemy.com/course/master-the-coding-interview-data-structures-algorithms/)** by Andrei Neagoie. This course provides a deep dive into foundational concepts of computer science and algorithmic thinking, aimed at mastering technical interview preparation.

## Course Overview

The course covers essential topics in data structures and algorithms, including:

- **Data Structures**: Arrays, Linked Lists, Hash Tables, Stacks, Queues, Trees, Graphs, and more.
- **Algorithms**: Sorting, Searching, Recursion, Dynamic Programming, Greedy Algorithms, and other algorithmic strategies.
- **Interview Preparation**: Tackling real-world interview problems and optimizing code for performance and readability.

## Structure

Each module within this repository is organized by topic, matching the structure of the course. Exercises vary in complexity and include explanations, code solutions, and, in some cases, multiple approaches to solve the same problem.
